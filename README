minetest-australopithecus-auto-pickup
=====================================

A system which allows players to automatically pick up items by just walking
close to them.


Features
--------

 * Items are first attracted and if close enough automatically added to
   the inventory.
 * Items are only attracted if there is enough space in the inventory to
   actually pick them up.
 * If items are dropped, there can only be picked up automatically after
   a certain time, means you can drop items without picking them right again.
 * Picking up an item makes a sound, which can either be only for the player
   or can be heard by all players.
 * Completely configurable from the tyhe configuration.


Usage
-----

The system activates itself, you just need to add the mod to the subgame.


Configuration
-------------

The system can be configured by adding settings to the `minetest.conf`:

    # If the system should be activated, defaults to true.
    autopickup_activate = true
    
    # The acceleration that is used when the object enters the acceleration
    # radius, defaults to "2, 0, 2". This is has three values, x, y and z.
    autopickup_attraction_acceleration = 2, 0, 2
    
    # The radius within which items are moved towards the player, defaults
    # to 1.5.
    autopickup_attraction_radius = 1.5
    
    # The minimum age (in seconds) which a dropped item must have before it can
    # be automatically picked up by the same player again, defaults to 4.
    autopickup_dropped_min_age = 4
    
    # The interval (in seconds) in which the system is running, defaults to 0.1.
    autopickup_interval = 0.1
    
    # The radius within which items are picked up, meaning added to the players
    # inventory, defaults to 0.9.
    autopickup_pickup_radius = 0.9
    
    # If a sound should be played when an item is picked up, defaults to true.
    autopickup_sound_enabled = true
    
    # The sound gain of the sound that is played, defaults to 0.5.
    autopickup_sound_gain = 0.5
    
    # If the sound should be hearable by other players, defaults to true.
    autopickup_sound_global = true
    
    # If autopickup_sound_global is set to true, defines the hearing distance,
    # defaults to 8.
    autopickup_sound_hear_distance = 8
    
    # The name of the sound files to play, defaults to "autopickup".
    autopickup_sound_name = autopickup


Run manually
------------

You can run the system manually, either for all players by invoking
`autopickup.pickup_items_all`, or for a single player by invoking
`autopickup.pickup_items` with accepts the player as the single argument.


Timed pickup
------------

The system does check the field `autopickup_timeout` if it should be picking
up the item or not. So another mod can set `autopickup_timeout` to prevent
an item from being picked up automatically, the set value is in seconds, and
after the set value the item will be picked up.


Disable pickup
--------------

The system does check the fields `autopickup_disable` if it should be picked up
automatically at all. So another mode can set `autopickup_disable` to `true` to
disable the automatic pickup for this item.


Force activation
----------------

You can force the activation of the system, even if it has been disable in
the configuration, by invoking `autopickup.activate_internal`.
